    "Reusability: Libraries offer reusable code, saving time and effort. Instead of reinventing the wheel, you can leverage existing, \n",

    "1. Data Type\n",
    "NumPy Array: Designed specifically for numerical computation. All elements in a NumPy array must be of the same data type \n",
    "(e.g., all integers, all floats).\n",
    "List: Can hold elements of different data types. You can have integers, floats, strings, and even other lists as elements \n",
    "within the same list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Performance\n",
    "NumPy Array: Much faster and more memory-efficient for numerical operations because they are implemented in C and optimized for performance. \n",
    "Operations on large datasets are significantly quicker.\n",
    "List: Slower for numerical operations as they are more general-purpose and don't have the same level of optimization as NumPy arrays.\n",
